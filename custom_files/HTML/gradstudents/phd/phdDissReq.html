            <p>The oral dissertation defense is to be made to the advisory committee although additional faculty or others may be in attendance. Draft copies of the dissertation must be distributed to the examining committee at least two weeks prior to the oral dissertation defense.</p>
            <p>In the oral dissertation defense, the student will spend approximately one hour presenting the dissertation work and approximately one hour responding to questions from the examining committee. The student will be judged on mastery of the dissertation subject area and on the quality of the dissertation work. The examining committee may vote as follows:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Pass.</li>
                <li>Pass with qualification. In this case the student must complete the minor revisions or requirements specified by the committee to the satisfaction of the committee chair who then sends a written approval to the Office of Graduate Studies.</li>
                <li>Recess. In this case the student must pass a second and final oral dissertation defense from the same examining committee no sooner than one month later.</li>
                <li>Fail. In this case the graduate degree program of the student is terminated.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>The Dissertation formatting must follow the guidelines found in ADV form 11</p>
            <p>The format and content of the dissertation must meet the approval of the advisory committee. In addition the format must meet approved college specifications. After receiving college approval, students are required to order two bound copies of the dissertation, one for their committee chair and one for the CE department. The designated colors are blue cover with gold lettering. Students may also order additional copies for their own use.
