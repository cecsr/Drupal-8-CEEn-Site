            <p>During the first semester, the student works with the graduate coordinator to form an advisory committee. The committee should have a chair and at least two other members. Students must meet with their committee chair/advisor after each fall and winter semester while at BYU. The student will be notified of the specific deadline each semester/term. The burden is on the student to schedule the meeting and to bring pertinent materials necessary for evaluation of the student's progress to the meeting as directed by the advisory committee chair. The graduate secretary will provide the committee chair/advisor with the student's file. The committee chair/advisor should evaluate and counsel the student with respect to the following requirements:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Course work/Study list</li>
                <li>Skill requirement</li>
                <li>Seminar Participation</li>
                <li>Examination requirements</li>
                <li>Thesis or Project</li>
                <li>Minimum registration</li>
                <li>Record keeping</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Following the meeting, the advisory committee will submit a written evaluation to the graduate program manager and provide the graduate student with a written evaluation of his or her progress as:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Satisfactory</li>
                <li>Marginal: In this case the student may continue provided that requirements specified by the advisory committee are met.</li>
                <li>Unsatisfactory: In this case the graduate degree program of the student is terminated.</li>
            </ol>

                    <h2>Senior Credit</h2>
                    <p>In some restricted instances students seeking a masterâ€™s degree may apply credit taken during the senior year at BYU toward the degree, but in no instance can this credit apply to both a baccalaureate and a graduate degree. Senior and postbaccalaureate credit combined cannot exceed 10 semester hours in a graduate program. Thoroughly qualified undergraduates who are willing and able to meet graduate level standards may enroll in graduate 500-level courses.</p>
