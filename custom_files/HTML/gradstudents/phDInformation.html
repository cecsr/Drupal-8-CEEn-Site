            <p>During the first semester the student should work with the graduate coordinator to form an advisory committee. The committee should have a chair and at least four other members. Students must meet with their committee chair/advisor after each fall and winter semester and at the end of spring/summer term while at BYU. The student will be notified of the specific deadline each semester/term. The burden is on the student to schedule the meeting and bring materials necessary for evaluation of the student's progress as directed by the advisory committee chair. The department secretary will provide the committee chair/advisor with the student's file including the most current evaluation forms. The committee chair/advisor should evaluate and counsel the student with respect to the following requirements:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Course work/study list</li>
                <li>Skill courses</li>
                <li>Seminar</li>
                <li>Comprehensive Examination</li>
                <li>Prospectus</li>
                <li>Dissertation</li>
                <li>Minimum registration</li>
                <li>Record keeping</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Following the meeting, the advisory committee will submit a written evaluation to the graduate secretary and provide the graduate student with a written evaluation of their progress as:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Satisfactory</li>
                <li>Marginal: In this case the student may continue provided that requirements specified by the advisory committee are met.</li>
                <li>Unsatisfactory: In this case the graduate degree program of the student is terminated.</li>
            </ol>
