            <h2>Undergraduate Program</h2>
            <p>Students in the BYU Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering work with nationally renowned professors, as they prepare for professional involvement in structural, water resources, environment, geotechnical (soils), and transportation engineering.</p>
            <p>Civil Engineers are employed in industry, private consulting, and government. Industries employing many civil and environmental engineers include construction, transportation, aerospace, petroleum, and mining. Many civil engineers enter private consulting practices, and many eventually establish their own firms.</p>
            <p>There are a vast variety of careers and job opportunities within the field of Civil Engineering.</p>
            <p>With a Civil Engineering Degree you can work for engineering consulting firms, architectural firms, construction companies, as well as in Federal, State, County, and City engineering departments.</p>

            <h3>Environmental/Water</h3>
            <p>Water resource and environmental engineers design pipeline systems, water treatment plants, dams, flood control structures, waste disposal sites, and environmental restoration projects. Computer modeling and analyses are used in design and to forecast storm runoff, flooding, and movement of contaminants in surface and subsurface waters. Environmental engineers evaluate and reduce pollutants from natural, human, agricultural, and industrial sources to preserve the beauty and quality of air, land, and water</p>

            <h3>Geotechnical</h3>
            <p>Geotechnical engineers design structures composed of or located within earth materials, including foundations for buildings and bridges, retaining walls, earth dams, highway embankments, tunnels, and liners for landfills. Field and laboratory tests on soil and rock, along with empirical and computer models, are used to assure safety and economy in design.</p>

            <h3>Structures</h3>
            <p>Structural engineers analyze and design buildings, bridges, and other structures. The engineer applies principles of physics, mathematics, and engineering to develop efficient yet safe designs. Sophisticated computer models are used in these analyses. Materials used by structural engineers include steel, aluminum, concrete, masonry, wood, and composites.</p>

            <h3>Transportation</h3>
            <p>Traffic and transportation engineers apply scientific principles to the planning, design, construction, operation, and management of transportation systems, including highways, airports, and mass transit facilities. Transportation engineers are responsible for the safe, rapid, comfortable, convenient, economical, and environmentally compatible movement of people and goods. Computer models and simulations are frequently used by traffic engineers for geometric design and for planning, operating, and managing transportation networks, including intermodal systems.</p>

            <h3>Other Opportunities with Civil Engineering</h3>
            <p>Many of our civil engineering students sign up with the BYU American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) chapter. This provides many benefits to student members as they gain their education as well as when they become a practicing engineer. ASCE involves students in many service opportunities and getting involved with the local community. The BYU ASCE student chapter has been recognized five times as the best student chapter in the nation.</p>
            <p>Many students choose to do one or more internships while here at BYU. Civil Engineering students who participate in an internship learn valuable skills and gain valuable field experience. Finding an internship is usually straightforward due to the fact that many companies come to BYU to recruit student interns for their company. Internships also give students favorable job contacts after graduation.</p>
            <p>If you would like to learn more about what Civil Engineers may be involved in, enrolling in CE EN 101 Introduction to Civil Engineering may be a good option for you. Enrolling in the course may give you a feel for what things you may do in a future civil engineering career.</p>
