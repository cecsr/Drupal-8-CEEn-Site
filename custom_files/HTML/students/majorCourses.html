            <p>This Course Scheduling Aid is provided for your convenience in planning your study program in Civil & Environmental Engineering. The department will make every effort to teach each class as scheduled. However, on occasion, it may be necessary to drop a class from the schedule due to a lack in enrollment or of suitable faculty to teach the course. It is very unlikely that any 100-495 courses will be affected; 500 and 600 level courses are more susceptible. Therefore, as you plan your program, your strategy should include options that will allow you to complete your studies in a timely manner even if one or two of your preferred courses should be canceled.</p>
